# wav files

After a long period of wanting to learn more about DSP,
I discovered [Direct to Wav](https://www.instagram.com/direct.to.wav/).
I guess Tyler started this mess.

Most of these scripts can be run on Linux by doing `./main.py && aplay whatever.wav`.

## Resources used so far
* http://blog.acipo.com/wave-generation-in-python/ is how I got my first tones
* http://blog.acipo.com/generating-wave-files-in-c/
* http://blog.acipo.com/handling-endianness-in-c/
* http://blog.bjornroche.com/2011/11/slides-from-fundamentals-of-audio.html helped me with some "big picture" stuff
    * Also has some helpfully suggestive bits on basic linear shift invariant (LSI) FX circuit schematics

## Planned reading
Still gotta plan the planned reading

## Fun next steps

* Add a delay or reverb channel to the mix using Bjorn's slides
    * Then add feedback to whichever effect was used
